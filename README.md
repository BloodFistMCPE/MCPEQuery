# MCPEQuery
Example code of MCPE Query. You can use this to query MCPE servers.

---
mcquery (aka py-mcpe-query) is a Python software that uses the query protocol to ping a Minecraft: Bedrock edition server for basic information.

Note: If you get a timeout error, it might be that the target server do not support the query protocol. If that happens, you can use mcstats instead, where you can ping a server without the query protocol.
